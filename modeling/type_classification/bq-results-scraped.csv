Lingayat seer exits contest against Union minister Pralhad Joshi

In Dharwad, Lingayat seer withdraws from polls to support Congress, sparking an anti-climax. Swami plans to continue his fight against Joshi's actions, backed by devotees and Lingayat Mutts supporters.

Can power-hungry pontiffs derail BJP plans in Karnataka?

BJP's stronghold in Karnataka under scrutiny. Lingayat pontiffs influence caste saffron politics. Basavaraj Bommai faces challenges. Karnataka's impact on general election crucial, as parties strategize in the southern state.

Hubballi: Fakir Dingaleshwar swamiji (in pic) has alleged that Union minister Pralhad Joshi is creating a tussle, between him and his senior pontiff Fakir Siddharam Mahaswamiji.On Saturday, swamiji told reporters that Joshi has met Fakir Siddharam swamiji, senior pontiff of Fakireshwar Sansthan Mutt Shirahatti during the election campaign to create a tussle.“When our senior pontiff had tried to contact Joshi after becoming Union minister, he had never received seer’s calls and never tried to meet him. He uses Lingayat mutts, seers and Lingayats at large only during the election. He is applying vibhuti on the foreheads of Lingayat seers and giving envelop to them and we have videos of the same. He is putting used shawls on seers. Despite all these dramas, he has been suppressing Lingayats for 20 years,” he lamented.He also said that he withdrew his nomination as per the instruction of his senior pontiff. He also said that Joshi is trying to divide guru and shishya. He warned that if Joshi continues the same, his personal relationships may be affected. “He even utilised Neha Hiremath’s murder for his political gains. It means he utilises the death of Lingayats for his mileage,” he lashed out. He urged his supporters, even those working in the BJP, to defeat Joshi in the LS election."

The 'lame duck' SNP leader has asked the parties to meet him this week to find 'common ground' after the fallout from his decision to dump the Scottish Greens and run a minority administration.

Mr Yousaf faces two votes of no-confidence at Holyrood this week – one against himself put forward by the Tories and one against his government proposed by Labour.

His grovelling letters were sent yesterday to leaders of the ­Conservatives, Labour, the Greens, Lib Dems and Alex Salmond's Alba Party.

He is desperate to persuade ex-SNP MSP Ash Regan, now the Alba leader at Holyrood, to back him on the no-confidence poll.

Yousaf is desperate to persuade ex-SNP MSP Ash Regan , now the Alba leader at Holyrood, to back him on the no-confidence poll

His fate could lie in her hands as Ms Regan – who Mr Yousaf once said was 'no great loss to the SNP' – could have the casting vote.

She has already submitted a list of demands, including over independence and gender, to the First Minister before she decides whether to lend her support.

Allies have confirmed she has received his letter and that there is an ­emergency Alba National Executive Committee meeting today to discuss what her red lines will be.

They say she will likely call on Mr Yousaf to strengthen his ­independence plans, move away from identity politics, accept the findings of the Cass gender ­treatment review and invest ­properly in key public services.

Holyrood arithmetic dictates Mr Yousaf would need at least 64 of the 129 MSPs to back him in order to win the no-confidence vote in him as First Minister. The SNP has 63 MSPs, leaving him one short.

It is possible Mr Yousaf could win over one or two Green MSPs, but it seems highly unlikely.

Other opposition parties appeared to be unmoved by his impassioned plea for support, with the dumped Greens, the Tories, Labour and Lib Dems yet to confirm if they will meet with the SNP leader.

Last night, Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross, who has written back to Mr Yousaf but not said if he will accept his invitation to Bute House, said: 'This is a humiliating and embarrassing letter, in which Humza Yousaf is begging to be allowed to keep his job.

'His belated abandonment of the Bute House Agreement with the toxic Greens... does nothing to undo the immense damage it has caused.

'Our NHS, schools, police and public services have all been profoundly hit by the spectacular mismanagement of the SNP-Green government under his leadership.

'Humza Yousaf now talks about delivering 'substantial benefits for people, communities and ­businesses', and only wants to discuss 'concerns and… priorities' now that his job is on the line.'

Calling for Mr Yousaf to resign, Mr Ross added: 'His future as First Minister rests on a vote that is currently so finely balanced his credibility as a leader will be utterly destroyed, whatever the result.'

Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross said Yousaf's future as First Minister 'rests on a vote that is currently so finely balanced his credibility as a leader will be utterly destroyed, whatever the result'

Writing to the leaders, Mr Yousaf said each group 'must contribute constructively... building consensus for the common good'.

Speaking outside his home in Dundee yesterday, he seemed open to working with Ms Regan.

He said: 'She has written to me and believes there are areas where we will be able to co-operate on.'"

A gold pocket watch that was recovered from the body of the richest man on the Titanic has sold for a record-breaking £1.175 million.

The watch was sold on Saturday to a private collector in the US at Henry Aldridge & Son in Devizes, Wiltshire, for the highest amount ever for Titanic memorabilia, the auctioneers said.

The original owner of the watch, businessman John Jacob Astor, 47, went down with the ship in 1912 after seeing new wife Madeleine onto a lifeboat.

The previous highest amount paid for Titanic artefacts was £1.1 million for a violin that was played as the ship sank – which sold at the same auction house in 2013, according to the auctioneers.

A spokesperson for the auctioneers said the £1.175 million was inclusive of fees and taxes paid by the buyer.

The case for the violin was sold at the same auction as the pocket watch at Henry Aldridge & Son on Saturday for £360,000 including fees and taxes.

Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge said that the prices fetched by the Titanic memorabilia at the sale were “absolutely incredible”.

John Jacob Astor ( Bettmann Archive )

He said: “They reflect not only the importance of the artefacts themselves and their rarity but they also show the enduring appeal and fascination with the Titanic story.

“112 years later, we are still talking about the ship and the passengers and the crew.

“The thing with the Titanic story, it’s effectively a large ship hits an iceberg with a tragic loss of life, but more importantly is 2,200 stories.

“2,200 subplots, every man woman and child had a story to tell and then the memorabilia tells those stories today.”

Rather than try his luck with another safety vessel, impeccably dressed Astor, who was a prominent member of the wealthy Astor family, was last seen smoking a cigarette and chatting with a fellow passenger.

His body was recovered from the Atlantic Ocean seven days later and his exquisite 14-carat gold Waltham pocket watch, engraved JJA, was found.

Mr Aldridge said: “Astor is well known as the richest passenger aboard the RMS Titanic and was thought to be among the richest people in the world at that time, with a net worth of roughly 87 million US dollars – equivalent to several billion dollars today.

“At 11.40pm on April 14 1912, the Titanic hit an iceberg and started to take on water.

“At first, Astor did not believe the ship was in any serious danger, but later it was apparent she was sinking and the captain had started an evacuation after midnight, so he helped his wife into lifeboat 4.”

Mrs Astor survived, and her husband’s body was recovered on April 22 not far from the sinking.

The watch was passed by Mr Astor’s son Vincent to the son of his father’s executive secretary, William Dobbyn."

Two guilty pleas came earlier this week. The four defendants include…

Elijah Briggs, 42

Jessica Kirkpatrick, 44

Reuben Kim, 36

Holly Naylor, 41

All four have pleaded guilty to two counts of bank fraud. Briggs also admitted to another count of bank fraud and two counts of aggravated identity theft.

According to the U.S. Department of Justice, offenses date back to 2019. Briggs admitted to stealing mail from homes, specifically mail with blank checks, while working as a contractor.

At some point, Briggs was caught with stolen mail belonging to dozens of people, which included more than 30 stolen debit or credit cards and over 100 checks in the names of others. Investigators say the total dollar amount on the stolen or fraudulent checks surpassed $116,000. Briggs also had a notebook containing the names and personally identifiable information of several people.

In October 2021, St. Charles officers found Briggs in possession of drugs, blank check paper and stolen or fraudulent checks that totaled $40,000 during a traffic stop.

Authorities also learned that Briggs created fraudulent checks that Kirkpatrick, Naylor and Kim later deposited. All three pleaded guilty to cashing in fraudulent checks that Briggs created.

He said his party will be able to hold on to the state seat, which is one of the party’s traditional strongholds. Matunggong, together with Bandau and Tandek, are three state seats in the Kota Marudu parliamentary seat.

Tandek is held by PBS’s Hendrus Anding, while the Bandau seat is held by Datuk Wetrom Bahanda, who contested as an Independent to defeat Ongkili’s two-decade hold on Sabah’s northern Kota Marudu seat in the 15th General Election.

Gunsalam said PBS has an edge to retain the Matunggong seat held by party secretary Datuk Julita Majungki.

“Party members should stay strong and rally behind the party that is championing the rights of the natives,” he said at the Matunggong PBS annual general meeting yesterday.

Gunsalam, who is Deputy Chief Minister II, said PBS and Sabah STAR, led by Datuk Seri Dr Jeffrey Kitingan, have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to work together on their common struggle while avoiding divisive politics.

He added this cooperation also strengthens the unity of the Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) government, led by Chief Minister Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor.

Gunsalam said that cooperation was necessary among all the seven parties in GRS to ensure that the incumbent GRS state government gets a strong win in the 73 state seats.

“No one party can dominate the 73-state assembly, and we need to work with friends to govern Sabah effectively,” he added."

City councillor Tan Soo Siang said a park visitor had spotted the lorry driver, in his 20s, committing the offence and called the MBPP hotline on Friday afternoon.

“A team rushed to the scene and waited in ambush. Photographs were snapped as evidence and as the lorry driver was dumping the third load, the enforcement personnel moved in and apprehended him at about 4pm.

“A police report was subsequently lodged, and he was released after being questioned. We also called up his employer to assist in our investigations,” Tan told reporters after visiting the site yesterday.

Also present were her fellow councillors Rohaizat Hamid, Benji Ang, Choong You Ray and Nicholas Theng.

Tan added that the case was referred to MBPP’s legal unit for prosecution under either the Local Government Act 1976 or the Street, Drainage and Building Act 1974, depending on which carries a more severe penalty.

“We view illegal dumping seriously and will continue to conduct regular operations to prevent such activities from happening in the state.

“Waste generators are responsible for ensuring that their appointed contractors transport and dispose of waste with a permit at a landfill approved by the council. Additionally, they should obtain a record of the waste weighing slip,” she said.

Though uncommon, lorry drivers are occasionally caught dumping construction debris illegally to save time and the fuel cost of sending the waste to approved landfills.

16,16,1,https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/justice-kavanaugh-warns-of-vicious-cycle-of-malicious-prosecutions-that-could-end-presidency-5638961,20240428,12,"‘This case has huge implications for the presidency, for the future of the presidency, for the future of the country,’ Justice Brett Kavanaugh says.

During Thursday’s deliberations at the U.S. Supreme Court on former President Donald Trump’s immunity claim, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh warned that a decision in the case has future implications for whether future presidents are shielded from vicious cycles of malicious prosecution that could effectively end the presidency as we know it.

In the course of two-and-a-half hours of oral arguments on April 25, justices on the Supreme Court appeared skeptical of a ruling by a federal appeals court that rejected President Trump’s claim that he has absolute immunity from criminal charges based on his official acts as president.

President Trump was indicted by special counsel Jack Smith in August 2023 on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

Pleading not guilty, the former president has argued that he should receive absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for acts that fell within the scope of his official duties. The exception to this immunity, he has argued, is if Congress impeaches and convicts him on charges.

A federal appeals court rejected that argument, claiming that presidents must face prosecution for alleged criminal wrongdoing.

The question that is now before the Supreme Court is: “Whether and if so to what extent does a former president enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office?”

During Thursday’s deliberations, the justices weighed the claim of absolute immunity that, if adopted, would stop Mr. Smith’s prosecution of the former president dead in its tracks.

Several conservative justices suggested they favor imposing limits on the prosecution of former presidents, while highlighting the importance of the case for the future.

Justice Kavanaugh said that when presidents are subject to prosecution, history shows that it’s not going to stop.

“It’s going to cycle back and be used against the current president or the next president ... and the next president and the next president after that.”

Justice Neil Gorsuch, who said that the court is “writing a rule for the ages,” along with Justice Samuel Alito and Justice Kavanaugh, all said that their concern was not so much the case against President Trump, but rather the effect of the ruling on future presidencies.

“This case has huge implications for the presidency, for the future of the presidency, for the future of the country,” Justice Kavanaugh said.

‘Rule for the Ages’ Former Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben, who argued for Mr. Smith, said that the framers of the U.S. Constitution never intended for presidents to be above the law.

Mr. Dreeben also said that the crimes President Trump is charged with—including allegedly participating in a scheme to enlist dueling electors in battleground states won by President Joe Biden to cast alternate slates of electoral votes for him—weren’t a part of the president’s official duties.

Attorney D. John Sauer, who argued for President Trump, told the justices that without presidential immunity from criminal charges, the “presidency as we know it” will be changed, contending that the looming threat is that a decision to deny immunity would “destroy” presidential decisionmaking at a time in the nation’s history when it needs to be bold.

Mr. Sauer argued that the impact of the case would have implications far beyond the question at hand, raising the hypothetical prospect of President Biden facing charges of encouraging illegal immigration with his border policies.

Justice Kavanaugh expressed concern about the future implications of the case, warning of the prospect of a vicious cycle of malicious prosecutions that could hamper presidents for years to come.

Mr. Drebeen contended that the laws currently on the books have not shown they are prone to abuse, telling the high court that “we’ve lived from Watergate through the present, through the independent counsel era with all of its flaws, without these prosecutions having gone off on a runaway train.”

Justice Kavanaugh argued that the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton presidencies were all “hampered” by investigations, while suggesting that holding a president accountable is less important than protecting the functioning of the presidency.

He raised the question of the “risk” of a “creative prosecutor” using “vague” statutes against a commander-in-chief, telling Mr. Dreeben that this case has “huge implications” for the presidency, and that he was “very concerned about the future.”

Justice Kavanaugh cited the Supreme Court’s 1988 decision in Morrison v. Olson, which upheld the constitutionality of the independent counsel statute, as “one of the Court’s biggest mistakes” because it “hampered” presidential administrations. He argued that when former presidents are subjected to prosecution, this risks triggering a vicious cycle of vindictive prosecutions.

“What would the reaction be if, in an area not covered by this statute, the Justice Department posted a public notice inviting applicants to assist in an investigation and possible prosecution of a certain prominent person?” he asked.

“Does this not invite what Justice Jackson described as picking the man and then searching the law books or putting investigators to work to pin some offense on him?”"

831,83,8,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bob-bakish-expected-resign-paramount-234401039.html,20240428,14,"Bob Bakish is expected to resign as Paramount Global CEO amid merger talks heating up with Skydance, IndieWire has learned and according to multiple media reports.

It’s expected that Bakish, who has been with the company since 1997, could step down as early as Monday, which would be ahead of the company’s earnings call on Monday afternoon. He was named CEO in 2019 back when the company was called ViacomCBS.

More from IndieWire

Reps for Paramount Global declined comment.

It’s a shocking move that comes just as Skydance is closing in on its acquisition of Shari Redstone’s National Amusements, the theater company that holds 77 percent of the controlling shares of Paramount Global.

The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that a Bakish ouster was a possibility, with some board members reportedly souring on his leadership, and CNBC first reported Saturday that his exit could be as soon as Monday. The WSJ says that Paramount is expected to put in place an “Office of the CEO” made up of the company’s various division heads who will lead the company on an interim basis, and CNBC reported that Bakish’s exit was accelerated due to being opposed to the Skydance merger.

It’s expected once a merger between Skydance and Paramount closes, David Ellison would become CEO, and there’s been no illusion that Bakish would have a role in the new company. Bakish does however have a golden parachute in place worth up to $50 million.

Bakish’s recent tenure has been marred by not pursuing a potential $3 billion sale of Showtime, the legacy networks such as CBS, MTV, VH1, BET, and Nickelodeon have continued to suffer in a declining market for linear TV, its credit rating was reduced to “Junk,” and Paramount+ remains far from profitability, with some analysts wondering if Paramount would have been better off not entering streaming and instead becoming an “arms dealer” licensing its content to other streamers. In 2019, Paramount’s market value was $25.3 billion but is now just $8.4 billion.

Looming over Bakish’s potential ouster is Paramount’s negotiations with Charter on a new deal, which proved contentious when Disney’s deal expired with the cable provider and led to a radical new arrangement between the two companies back in September.

Skydance entered into exclusive negotiations with National Amusements on April 3, though talks are expected to extend past the 30-day window. However, Sony alongside Apollo Management Global are waiting in the wings to make their own offer after Redstone passed on Apollo’s offers for both the individual Paramount film and TV studios and Paramount Global as a whole.

The incident occurred at 5:13 p.m. on April 26 when police were called to the scene following reports of the animals obstructing traffic.

Calls later indicated that Ty Morrison, 37, of Orleans, and Michael Cyr, 57, of Brownington, were engaged in a physical altercation in the same location.

Upon arrival, troopers found Morrison and Cyr amidst a heated dispute, which reportedly began over the presence of the pigs, which neither man owned or was responsible for.

The confrontation escalated to violent and tumultuous behavior, alarming onlookers and disrupting the peace.

Both Morrison and Cyr received citations to appear in Orleans County Superior Court to face charges related to the incident."

I have always believed that “love conquers all”. Recently I found myself having to choose between holding on to being wronged or forgiving in love.

While I know forgiveness doesn’t mean forgetting — Power of Forgiveness. As admitted by my friend, I was the wronged party and it felt justified to hold on to my grudge without forgiving and yet claim to be loving.

I felt like a hypocrite and realized while forgiveness is intertwined in love, not forgiving can’t lead to love.

Love is often portrayed as an unbreakable bond, a force that conquers all obstacles. But woven into the fabric of love lies a crucial element without which its endurance is questioned: forgiveness.

Can true love truly exist without it?

…

Forgiveness, the act of letting go of resentment and granting pardon, it is often hailed as the cornerstone of healthy relationships.

It acknowledges imperfections, embraces growth, and fosters reconciliation.

Yet, in the labyrinth of love, there are instances where this vital ingredient seems absent, leaving behind a question mark hanging over the relationship’s authenticity.

In exploring this paradox, let me delve into another personal story — a tale of love tested by the absence of forgiveness.

I once knew a couple, let’s call them Sarah and James, whose love story was akin to a fairytale. Their love seemed invincible, weathering storms that would have shattered lesser bonds. But beneath the surface lurked unresolved grievances, buried beneath layers of affection.

Sarah, a fiercely independent soul, held onto past hurts with a tenacity that rivaled her love for James. When James inadvertently betrayed her trust, she built walls around her heart, refusing to grant him the absolution he sought. Their love became a battleground, with resentment poisoning the well of affection that once nourished them.

Unforgiveness took a toll on their relationship.

Bitterness replaced tenderness, and communication turned into confrontation.

Despite their professed love, the absence of forgiveness cast a shadow over their union, leaving them adrift in a sea of unresolved emotions.

…

This story serves as a poignant reminder of the intricate dance between love and forgiveness. For love to thrive, forgiveness must be embraced — not as a sign of weakness, but as a testament to the strength of the human spirit.

Famous voices throughout history have echoed this sentiment, illuminating the symbiotic relationship between love and forgiveness:

· Mahatma Gandhi once said, “The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.” In love, true strength lies in the ability to forgive, to transcend the wounds of the past and embrace the possibility of renewal.

· Martin Luther King Jr. spoke of the transformative power of forgiveness, stating, “We must develop and maintain the capacity to forgive. He who is devoid of the power to forgive is devoid of the power to love.” Love, in its purest form, is intertwined with forgiveness, for it is through forgiveness that love finds its true expression.

· The Dalai Lama emphasized the liberating nature of forgiveness, stating, “Anger, hatred, and jealousy never solve problems, only affection, concern, and respect can do that.” In the landscape of love, forgiveness serves as a catalyst for healing, allowing affection to triumph over resentment.

In reflecting on these words, we cannot escape the conclusion that true love and forgiveness are inextricably linked.

Love devoid of forgiveness is but a shadow of its potential, a fragile vessel adrift in turbulent waters.

…

Amidst the complexity of human relationships, there exists a glimmer of hope — a beacon of light that illuminates the path to reconciliation. For forgiveness is not merely an act, but a journey — a journey towards understanding, empathy, and ultimately, love.

In the end, Sarah and James embarked on that journey, navigating the rough terrain of their emotions with courage and vulnerability. And though their road was fraught with challenges, they emerged stronger, their love tempered by the fires of forgiveness.

I also learnt in my personal relationship that to truly love you must forgive, holding on to hurts, injustice, doesn’t nothing but tear apart to fragments the love.

…

The enduring power of love — a power that transcends boundaries, overcomes obstacles, and embraces the transformative magic of forgiveness is the basis for its sustenance. To love and not be prepared to forgive, is better not to love. For unfortunately, the hurt we feel the most comes from those we love.

In conclusion, can true love exist without forgiveness?

Perhaps not in its fullest, most radiant form.

For in the tapestry of love, forgiveness weaves the threads that bind hearts together, transforming mere affection into an unbreakable bond — a bond forged in the crucible of human experience, enriched by the profound grace of forgiveness.

Nestled at the foot of Shushan Mountain, beside the tranquil Lihe River, Gunan Street in Yixing, Jiangsu province, whispers tales of a bygone era. Once the vibrant heart of zisha, or reddish-brown pottery production, this historical street pulsated with the creativity of artisans and the commerce of traders.

Today, after undergoing extensive renovation, it has become a gathering place for a new generation of craftsmen dedicated to preserving the unique artistry of zisha pottery.

In April 2010, the Jiangsu provincial government officially recognized this area as the Shushan Gunan Street historical and cultural block. The district's layout, with the river encircling the mountain and the street running parallel, has preserved the essence of zisha pottery production, trade, and transportation since the Ming and Qing dynasties (1368-1911).

Chu Chengliang, vice-president of the Yixing folk cultural relics and artifacts association, explains that the preservation and restoration of this neighborhood were spearheaded by the government. They set the precedent by selecting five key areas, inspiring residents to prioritize preservation and undertake necessary upgrades to their own homes.

""The local government regularly gathers feedback and advice from local residents about how to maintain and improve the district,"" Chu adds. ""Then they review these suggestions at the end of the year to see what they've accomplished. This has really got people involved in sprucing up our neighborhood.""

Today, Gunan Street is not just a place to study the history and culture of zisha pottery, it has become a lively community where artisans and experts in the craft thrive. Many old houses along the street are now leased by craftsmen for pottery making and habitation, attracting lots of young talent.

""The government kept the street's original vibe intact, even restoring some historical features,"" Chu explains. He mentions that by hosting events like weekend markets, they have brought in young people. The revamped shops on Gunan Street are not just pottery stores, however; there are also dining options, making the street more diverse. Many local residents have also moved back, turning their homes into small craft workshops, art shops, and tea houses.

Led by Wang Jianguo, a professor at Southeast University's School of Architecture, the team has designed many public spaces in the area, in collaboration with the local government, enhancing local life. They have also helped plan the restoration of several houses and provided design services to the community.

""We've taken a gradual approach to renovation,"" explains Shen Yang, another Southeast University architecture professor and a member of Wang's team.

""We've even designed model rooms to help residents with their own renovation, showing precise dimensions for doors, windows, pillars and beams.

""While the area may not have many large traditional courtyards, it's a lively neighborhood. The transformation of the district is an ongoing process without a definite endpoint,"" he says."
874,87,8,https://gazette.com/news/education/special-education-program-struggles-in-academy-d-20-school-detailed-district-responds/article_d7aa28f4-00ce-11ef-b1b2-4f737774f4fe.html,20240428,23,"A state complaint has prompted Academy District 20 to address the special education program at one of its schools following instructional losses and staff turnover over the past two school years.

The complaint alleged that D-20 denied a student their right to a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) by failing to implement their individualized education program (IEP) while they attended an unnamed elementary school in the district.

Dwindling staff, abuse by a teacher and an unsafe environment making instruction nearly impossible were detailed in an investigation conducted by the Colorado Department of Education in response to the complaint.

The district must now enact a number of changes to address each violation identified at the school over the next year.

The investigation, which includes interviews with parents, staff and teachers, along with district documentation, ultimately found that D-20 had violated state and federal law by failing to implement or revise multiple students’ individualized education programs (IEP).

“In sum, despite a high level of support provided by the District, this time period from the beginning of the 2023-2024 school year to October 10 posed, by all credible accounts, a great challenge to adequately addressing the SSN program Students’ needs,” state complaint officer Nicholaus Podsiadlik wrote in the state's decision.

The significant support needs (SSN) program refers to the program in place at a school for students with a number of greater needs including cognition, communication, movement, and social and emotional abilities. Students in these programs may also have health, sensory, physical, or behavioral disabilities.

An IEP is a document unique to every student who attends a public school and receives special education in compliance with the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and state Exceptional Children’s Education Act (ECEA).

The primary reason for failing to meet these needs was reportedly due to a lack of needed staff.

2022-23

The parents of a student at the school alleged it failed to implement the student's IEP during the 2022-23 and 2023-24 school years.

The loss of learning is traced back to Nov. 1, 2022, when the complainant’s student’s full-time SSN teacher went on anticipated leave through Feb. 20. This led to instructional inconsistencies for the 10 students in the program that year.

Challenges included a long-term substitute teacher resigning, hiring multiple short-term substitutes without special education endorsements and a fluctuating number of paraprofessionals.

“When necessary, other staff at School would also help supervise the SSN program,” Podsiadlik said.

The teacher prepared learning arrangements for each student and their IEP, but this ultimately proved to be unsuccessful due to a lack of consistency. Upon her return, she noted the students showed some regression but were able to recover by the end of the school year.

Parents, however, reported behavioral loses over this period that were never recovered.

2023-24

The teacher informed the district they would not return to the program for the 2023-24 year. This vacancy wasn’t filled by the start of the year and the program now had five paraprofessionals and 13 students with “significant medical, behavioral, and academic needs.”

Featured Local Savings

The school’s principal emailed D-20’s Executive Director for Special Education on Aug. 11 to express concern that support was insufficient going into the year.

“We need immediate assistance in SSN. Our paras are not in a good spot and may quit if attention is not given,” he wrote. “The tutor that was sent had no idea how to support SSN and no one else has been here … We don’t have any support in setting up our schedules and more students are being added to our caseload.”

Eleven short-term substitutes were hired over this time before a new full-time SSN teacher was eventually hired in October, leading to further inconsistency and aggressive behavior by students.

One student’s gastronomy tube was pulled out multiple times, while others hit staff and attempted to elope. On Sept. 26, one student, who required “adult supervision and support throughout the school day to ensure safety,” was found inside a closed dryer in a locked bathroom.

Two paraprofessionals resigned during this time and, following the dryer incident, the principal would also leave the school.

D-20 officials would then become involved in the SSN program and provide supplemental staff with varying credentials along with greater expert support to relieve staff and continue program operation.

“Even the service providers — the physical therapist, occupational therapist, and speech-language pathologist — pitched in during their visits to supervise the children and give the paraprofessionals a break,” Podsiadlik said.

“There were, at times, no teacher in the room, as few as one or two paraprofessionals, and ‘daily schedule and routine changes due to a revolving door of substitute and district staff supporting in the classroom.’”

When the new teacher was hired in October, struggles continued, both in educating students and supervising their behavior. Instructional time was largely spent responding to unsafe behaviors, tending to students' hygiene and helping students eat, drink, and use the bathroom.

The new teacher would also resort to physical intervention and verbal outbursts toward students out of frustration. Parents’ around this time consistently expressed concerns over the students' safety and regressing academic and functional performance.

They began transferring their children from the program and, by the time the new teacher resigned on Feb. 12, only seven students were enrolled in the program.

A new licensed teacher was then hired by the district March 11, but the state of the program by that point still made meeting each child’s IEP needs a challenge.

“The SCO finds that … the opportunity for instruction was minimal, no expert was able to provide individualized adjustments to match the children’s performance, and the environment diminished Students’ ability to learn,” Podsiadlik said.

Going Forward

The state concluded that D-20 didn’t implement the specialized instruction and curriculum modifications required by the students’ IEPs, monitor or report their progress, resulting in a denial of FAPE.

To resolve these violations, the CDE ordered the district to submit a corrective action plan that addresses each violation noted in the complaint along with 64 hours of compensatory education for students during the summer to meet each student’s IEP goals, in addition to speech-language therapy, occupational therapy and behavioral education as compensatory services. All hours are to be completed ahead of the 2024-25 school year, but parents may opt out of some or all of this education. The services must be completed within the year without exception.

D-20’s communication department provided a statement to the Gazette confirming its work on resolving all the findings through a corrective action plan.

“Although we will not expressly comment on individual claims associated with this complaint, D20 is committed to working with all of our families to ensure the success of each and every student,” the statement read.

The district went on to say they have met with each family to ensure their needs are met, began offering compensatory services and added efforts and leadership in the school and program mentioned in the complaint."
831,83,8,https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/webster-university-chancellor-s-pay-surpassed-1-million-in-2022/article_546cf474-fc34-11ee-8c4c-73596e37fee0.html,20240428,24,"WEBSTER GROVES — Chancellor Beth Stroble’s reported compensation grew to more than $1 million in 2022, including a bonus of more than $120,000, as financial problems worsened at Webster University.

In an email last week to the university’s faculty and staff, Board Chair Sumit Verma noted that Stroble and President Julian Schuster’s pay for the 2022 calendar year, the most recent publicly available, included performance bonuses from the previous year, and future years were unlikely to include such bonuses.

“It is important for you to also know the chancellor, president and board agreed that — given the financial situation of the university — performance awards in subsequent years were reduced and/or eliminated entirely, regardless of how other goals may have been performed,” Verma said.

Moreover, Stroble voluntarily gave up about $104,000 of her deferred compensation that year when she decided to retire.

The details were revealed last week when the university’s most recent tax documents were made public. Tax reporting for nonprofits like Webster University is typically delayed as part of the Internal Revenue Service filing process. The documents reflect the school's 2022-2023 fiscal year, but pay only for calendar year 2022.

The university declined to release pay for the 2023 calendar year.

Sign up for the Brick City newsletter Steph Kukuljan and other business reporters bring you insights into St. Louis-area real estate and development.

The tax filings highlight the continuing challenges facing the university, which saw administrator pay balloon over the past decade, even as enrollment fell by 50% and the institution lost $167 million in revenue.

University leaders, though, point to the university’s recent gains in enrollment and say Webster is on the rebound.

“Great days are ahead for Webster University,” Verma said in the email to faculty and staff.

Enrollment improved this past school year, but finances remained a problem. The university plans to use more than $30 million in endowment funds, typically earmarked for research, professorships and scholarships, to meet a loan obligation and improve its financial stature.

Meanwhile, morale at the Webster Groves-based institution worsened. Faculty, staff and students grew more frustrated with the board and leaders’ lack of transparency surrounding administrators’ compensation after a series of reports from the Post-Dispatch. It prompted a public callout, vote of no confidence and a protest.

The mounting pressure and media attention led Stroble, who had served at Webster for 15 years, to announce her resignation in December. She is taking a sabbatical, and her retirement is slated to take effect on June 30. A search for her replacement is underway.

Stroble will forfeit $629,000 by choosing to retire, financial documents show. Neither the board nor the university have confirmed if she will receive a salary when she returns in the fall as “chancellor emeritus.” She’s expected to focus on alumni relations and fundraising in that role.

The tax filings show that nearly all of the university’s highest-paid administrators received more money in 2022. But total compensation for Schuster, the president, fell 9% from the previous year to $778,133. Chief Financial Officer Rick Meyer, who recently retired, also saw an 18% decline to $160,962.

Stroble’s pay increased 2% from the previous year, when she received $992,000.

The documents showed that contributions to the university in 2022-23 decreased by 78% — a result of COVID-19 pandemic funds ending.

They also revealed that her daughter, Emily Stroble, earned $48,084 as a university employee in 2022. Emily Stroble’s LinkedIn page shows she is employed as a student access coordinator. She was first hired in December 2021 as a department assistant for financial aid.

Webster did not disclose her status in tax filings during her first year of employment. Spokesman Patrick Giblin said Emily Stroble’s gross compensation for that year was below the IRS threshold — $10,000 — for reporting a family member of a key employee.

He declined to disclose how much she made that year, saying that information is confidential.

Beth Stroble’s husband, Paul Stroble, earned $15,000 for his work as a part-time adjunct professor at the university, where he has taught for 14 years. Webster has long reported his association with the university.

And the filings also reveal that the $1.9 million that was “misappropriated” and first disclosed in a recent audit was stolen I.T. equipment.

The university reported in its filings that it has added a surveillance camera and has started a database to track its equipment.

Editor's note: The most current Webster University tax form reflected 2022 calendar-year pay. This story has also been updated to reflect Stroble's loss of deferred compensation that year."

Additionally, Soren has moved the Supreme Court seeking relief, challenging his arrest and emphasizing the urgency of the matter, especially in light of the ongoing Lok Sabha elections. Senior Advocate Kapil Sibal, representing Soren, informed the Supreme Court bench about the pending decision on Soren’s petition challenging his arrest before the Jharkhand High Court, urging for an expedited hearing.

In February, the Jharkhand High Court reserved its judgment on Soren’s plea, wherein he contested the legality and arbitrary nature of his arrest and subsequent remand. Soren, through his advocate Pragya Baghel, asserted that his arrest was unwarranted and mired in malice, while also seeking interim bail during the legal proceedings.

The arrest of Hemant Soren, a prominent political figure and Chairperson of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), had sparked widespread speculation and garnered significant media attention. The Directorate of Enforcement (ED) had apprehended Soren in January in connection with a land scam investigation, involving the alleged forging of official records to acquire valuable land parcels through fraudulent means.

The probe focuses on the purported manipulation of land transactions, leading to the generation of substantial illegal proceeds. Soren’s arrest and subsequent legal battles have added to the political intrigue in Jharkhand, with the case poised to have far-reaching implications in the region’s political landscape.

As the legal proceedings unfold, the fate of Hemant Soren remains uncertain, with his plea for interim bail adding a new dimension to the ongoing saga surrounding the land scam case.

Rampur, April 27

Leader of the Opposition Jai Ram Thakur and BJP candidate from Mandi Lok Sabha seat Kangana Ranaut held an election rally in the Jhakri area of Rampur subdivision in Shimla district today.

Thakur sought votes from people saying the BJP was needed for the development of the country and the state. He added that the Congress candidate from Mandi Vikramaditya Singh is speaking with great enthusiasm these days. When a person speaks excessively in excitement, he loses his senses.

He urged people, “When Vikramaditya Singh comes to your area, you must ask him why did his government close 11 institutions that the previous BJP government had opened for the development and welfare of the area. Why Vikramaditya did not raise his voice then?

Kangana said that if Congress ministers had morality, considering the recent political crisis in the state, they would have resigned. She added, “If anyone has thought about respect and representation of women, it is Narendra Modi. That is why Modiji has brought 33 per cent reservation for women.”

She said that in the 2029 Assembly elections, 22 out of 68 MLAs in the state would be women. “Even today everyone knows that Narendra Modi will become Prime Minister again. In the absence of the double-engine government, the development of Himachal has stopped. The Congress government is crying hoarse about a financial crisis. If I am elected to the Lok Sabha, I will work for the development of Himachal,” she added.

Two CRPF personnel were killed and two others injured as militants attacked a camp of security forces in Manipur’s Bishnupur district in the early hours of Saturday, the police said.

The militants attacked an IRBn (India Reserve Battalion) camp at Naranseina in the Moirang police station area. “They fired indiscriminately from hilltops, targetting the camp. It started around 12.30 am and continued till about 2.15 am. The militants also hurled bombs, one of which exploded in the outpost of CRPF’s 128 battalion,” a senior police officer said. The deceased were identified as sub-inspector N Sarkar, a native of Assam’s Kokrajhar district, and head constable Arup Saini of Bankura district in West Bengal, he said.

The injured were inspector Jadav Das and constable Aftab Das, he said, adding that they received splinter wounds. “The two injured personnel were admitted to the Regional Institute of Medical Sciences in Imphal. They are out of danger,” the officer said.

The CRPF personnel were deployed to provide security to the IRBn camp. A massive search was underway to find the perpetrators. CM N Biren Singh said, “Such actions demonstrate cowardice against dedicated security personnel. Their sacrifice will not go in vain.”

In another incident, a gunfight broke out between two groups at Sinam Kom on the border of Kangpkopi and Imphal East districts on Friday night, following which a 33-year-old man was found dead.

35,35,3,https://udaipurkiran.com/snapdragon-x-elite-appeared-on-geekbench-and-outperformed-apples-m3-chip-in-the-multi-core-test/,20240428,33,"Snapdragon A Surface Laptop 6 listing on Geekbench shows that Microsoft’s next Surface Laptop could outperform Apple’s MacBook Pro model with the latest M3 chip in a single CPU test. According to recent reports, Microsoft could unveil the Surface Laptop with a Snapdragon X Elite chip at a hardware event in May.

The Surface Laptop 6 was spotted by WCCFTech on Geekbench, but there was no official product name. The phone is listed as “OEMBR product name MFG” and the details show that it is powered by a 4.01GHz 12-core Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 chipset. It’s worth noting that Snapdragon X Elite comes in three versions and the benchmark model wasn’t the most powerful chip. Its variant (XIE-84-100) has a boost clock speed of 4.20 GHz.

The Surface Laptop 6, which is said to be powered by a Snapdragon X Elite chip, has a single-core score of 2,714 and a multi-core score of 14,078. The chip outperforms Apple’s 14-inch MacBook Pro M3 in Geekbench’s multi-core test, which scored 3,103 and 12,065 points, respectively.

If these benchmark tests are real, Apple’s M3 chip should be 13.37 percent faster than the Snapdragon X Elite in the Surface Laptop 6. Meanwhile, the Qualcomm chip is 15.4 percent faster than the M3 MacBook Pro. After all, the Snapdragon processor has more cores (12) than Apple’s M3 chip (8).

It’s worth taking these benchmarks with a grain of salt, as Microsoft hasn’t yet announced any plans to launch new Surface models with Snapdragon laptop chips. According to a recent report, Microsoft is said to be confident that the Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6 can outperform Apple’s latest 3nm silicon processors.

We can expect more details about these rumored devices to be released soon. Microsoft is expected to unveil new Surface laptops with Snapdragon chips at its next hardware event next month."

The SWEF enterprise grant, awarded by the Foundation, helps young people aged 18 to 30 who are running or about to start their own business - with costs such as tools, stock and rent.

The grant has enabled Beatrix to launch her own website and create a more professional studio to work in at home, as well as buying new equipment.

Beatrix said: “My mum came across the SWEF grant but I didn't originally want to apply because I don't really like video calls and I knew a video interview was part of the process.

“It was quite a relief to get the grant because it meant that I could follow through all these ideas I had that I wanted to achieve, that I couldn't before because it's such a long process, making a little bit of money and then reinvesting it.”

Beatrix has always had a fascination with making her own jewellery but it was only after finding sea glass on the beach while walking to her dad’s house in Lyme Regis that she had the idea of using it in her own designs.

A job on a jewellery maker’s market stall in Bridport then gave her the opportunity to sell some of her designs.

Beatrix said: “She was kind enough let me have a little section with my jewellery and people liked my designs, so then I decided to have my own little table with my bead designs and my sea grass design.

“I started making money from it which I used to reinvest and I kind of just built up and up and up from there.”

She added: “Originally I was polishing everything by hand so I could only really make five pieces a day and then I wouldn't have much to sell at the market.

“One of the tools I bought was a tumbler that polishes everything so now I'm able to make a good amount of things and make more money to build up my business.

She now produces around 70 pieces of jewellery a week to sell via her website or at markets in the Bridport area.

Beatrix added: “It’s a full time job now.

“I hope to move out of home soon and into my own place with a studio. I’m so glad that I applied for the grant because if I hadn't got that I would be like a year behind where I am now.”

On April 17, the students accepted a deal from the District Attorney’s Office for charges against the protestors to expire on May 16, pending no further arrests before then.

Now, demonstrators from March 21 are navigating the potential consequences of participating in further protest activity, namely with the pro-Palestine encampment on the Arts Quad established on Thursday.

On Thursday, encampment participants were informed that they risked arrest or academic suspension if they remained in the area after 8 p.m. At 3:08 p.m. on Friday, four students — including two international graduate students — were notified that they were temporarily suspended by email.

One of these protestors was Nick Wilson ’26, who was also arrested due to the Day Hall occupation. Other Day Hall participants have been seen participating in the encampment with differing degrees of involvement.

As the encampment continues for a third day, and the administration committed to further temporary suspensions, student protesters are navigating possibilities of disciplinary action and arrest, with some considering the potential violation of their existing dismissal deal for Day Hall arrests.

Prof. Sujata Gibson, law, principal attorney at The Gibson Law Firm, previously served as assigned counsel for the Day Hall demonstrators through Tompkins County Assigned Counsel.

Gibson explained that charges could open back up if protestors violate the terms of the arrest deal, called an Adjournment in Contemplation of Dismissal, also referred to as an ACD, if the Day Hall demonstrators were re-arrested.

“Now, if the [second] charges were completely flimsy, there may be a way to negotiate that or discuss it. But that would have to be a matter for negotiation,” Gibson said. “The D.A. would have every right to open it back up.”

According to Gibson, past trespassing charges and allegations should not be a factor in determining the severity of a second potential charge. Gibson also explained that breaking the terms of the current ACD could decrease the likelihood that the District Attorney’s Office will provide a similar option again, though she noted there are other factors that go into a decision like that.

Some of the Day Hall participants said they considered the threat of being arrested again changed when deciding upon their involvement in the encampment.

Maral Asik ’24, one of the arrested protestors from the Day Hall occupation, decided to limit her involvement with the encampment based on her ACD deal. Asik is not an organizer of the encampment or participating inside the encampment.

“Personally, I want to go to grad school. Financially, I’m not prepared to take another semester and have to pay for it if I were to get suspended,” Asik said. “Because [suspensions and arrests] just seem way more likely now, especially because I have a prior record, … I have a risk limit and those things are beyond it.”

Elliot Walsh ’24, another arrested protestor from Day Hall, shared Asik’s decision to limit his involvement with the encampment specifically because of the previous legal action taken against him by the University.

“For me, it feels like the more that I’ve accrued, the more nerve wracking it is to do anything,” Walsh said. “The reasons behind the sort of discipline — legally and within the University — that people have gotten is intended to have this chilling effect to discourage people from continuing.”

On Thursday, University administrators told protestors to remove tents by 1 p.m. or face disciplinary action, up to and including suspension, and to vacate the premises by 8 p.m., marked with threats of arrests and suspension. Neither deadline was met.

But no students were arrested and the four students — who represent a small fraction of the approximately 50 encampment participants — were not suspended till Friday afternoon.

The University’s delayed response to the Arts Quad encampments differs from its immediate arrest of 22 students and two staff members at the Day Hall occupation when they passed the 6 p.m. deadline to leave.

In an interview with The Sun on Friday before his suspension, Wilson said he believed that due to the encampment’s public location, the administration avoided immediate arrests to limit public image concerns.

“[The University] can’t avoid the fact that at the end of the day, we’re peers, we’re friends, we’re classmates, we’re people that people recognize on this campus, and that if they publicly do something to harm us, that’s something that’s going to happen in the public eye,” Wilson said.

When asked about the risk of legal or disciplinary action, especially since he had already been arrested Wilson said, “Right now my friends and my classmates are under attack. … And there’s really no consequence, I think, that would keep me and keep many others from standing with my friends.“

At around 7:45 p.m. on Thursday evening, over 100 people formed a human chain around the encampment as the 8 p.m. deadline to vacate the premises neared. Wilson stated that the display of community support provided additional security in the face of disciplinary or legal action.

“Ultimately, our safety is in the hands of our community and for students who have a friend in the encampment or know someone who has been involved in this action,” Wilson said. “It falls to those students to stand up for their friends to stand up for their community and ensure their safety.”

The encampment remains dedicated to protesting despite the recent suspensions.

In a statement released by the Coalition for Mutual Liberation — the organization behind the encampment — after the four suspensions, the organization reaffirmed its commitment to continuing the protest and advocating for its demands.

“They seek to intimidate other students to keep us from fighting for collective, mutual liberation,” the statement read. “But we are not scared. We will not be intimidated. And we will not stop demanding justice and liberation.”

While Asik has limited her involvement in the encampment, she said protestors are determined to continue peacefully demonstrating amid potential legal and academic consequences due to their care for the cause.

“I think that the value of civil disobedience is saying ‘I care about this so much [that] I am not going to harm you,’” Asik said. “‘I’m going to harm myself.’”

""Today, the RM voted to re-zone our old hall from Parks and Recreation to Residential. So, that's basically going to allow us, once we're in our new hall, to sell off our old hall property and convert it into residential neighbourhood.""

DeLong added that they community is working on a plan that would see them sell the land to establish more homes on the lot.

""We're hoping we can have a buyer come in and help develop housing in the area. It's a nice in-fill, it's already surrounded by houses, it's close to the school, it's close to the main street. So, we're hoping it will be a little bit of a boost to the town that way, and it just fits because we're going into the new hall, so there's no practical use to us for that place anymore.""

DEHRADUN,

AN IAF helicopter was pressed into service on Saturday to extinguish the raging forest fires in Uttarakhand’s Nainital district, Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said. The situation in the district worsened on Friday with the flames reaching the High Court Colony in the Pines area. An MI-17 helicopter collected water in a Bambi Bucket from Bhimtal lake and poured it over the burning forests of Pines, Bhumiadhar, Jyolikot, Narayan Nagar, Bhawali, Ramgarh and Mukteshwar areas of the district, officials said. Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said all efforts are being made to bring the fires under control and it will be done soon. “An IAF helicopter has already started dousing the fires,” he said. Dhami said he will hold a meeting with forest officials in Haldwani later in the day to review the situation. Three people were arrested in Rudraprayag on Friday while trying to set fire to forests.

As many as 31 fresh incidents of forest fire were reported from various parts of the state on Friday, destroying 33.34 hectares of forest land, according to officials.The fire that broke out in the forest near Nainital took a horrific form on Friday, posing a threat to the residents of High Court Colony. It also affected traffic movement in the area. Besides forest department staff, Army personnel are involved in efforts to control the fire. Anil Joshi, a resident of the Pines area and assistant registrar of the Uttarakhand High Court said, “The fire had engulfed an old and vacant house located near The Pines on Friday. It did not cause any damage to High Court Colony but it came dangerously close to the buildings.” The administration has banned boating in Naini lake in view of the blaze."

Most plans will be decided by council planning officers, using their legally delegated powers, but some of the most significant or contentious will go before one of the council’s five planning committees.

Planning committees are made up of elected councillors, but the decisions they make should be decided based on the council’s planning policies, not local politics.

Somerset Timber Services Ltd., Allerford Road, Allerford

Somerset Timber Services is a family-run sawmill which operates just outside Norton Fitzwarren, on the north-western edge of Taunton.

The company is looking to diversify its operations by converting part of its existing base into four light industrial units.

The new units will still be access from the current site entrance on Allerford Road, with the option to convert the building back to its original state depending on the needs of the business.

Planning reference number: 27/24/0017

Sandys Hill Lane, Frome

Construction is currently proceeding on 198 homes within the Keyford Meadows site either side of Sandys Hill Lane on the southern edge of Frome.

As part of the outline permission for the development, which was secured in July 2020, new commercial units will be provided at the western edge of the site, near the existing Wessex Fields retail units.

TJ Morris Ltd. has now applied to build the first of these new units near the Sainsbury’s supermarket – with strong indications from the planning documents that it may end up being occupied by Home Bargains.

Planning reference number: 2024/0428/REM

A38 Bristol Road, Bridgwater

46 Bristol Road in Bridgwater, near the Bird in Hand public house, is already being operated as a house of multiple occupation (HMO) with four residents.

Mrs S. Nuttall is now applying to alter the property to allow twice as many people to live under the same roof.

The property lies on one of Bridgwater’s busiest roads, just north of the Cross Rifles roundabout – which will shortly be upgraded using money from the government’s levelling up fund.

Planning reference number: 08/24/00040

Manor Road, Cossington

Graham Wason has applied to build a new industrial unit and workshop on this agricultural land to the south of the grade two listed Cossington House and the surrounding Cossington Park.

A new access road will be created on Manor Road, with the new workshop being constructed to store maintenance tools and associated machinery.

A total of 29 car parking spaces will be created on site which can be used by leisure users at Cossington Park.

Planning reference number: 22/24/00002

Wyke Farms, Wyke Champflower

Wyke Farms has applied to build a combined heat and power engine (CHP) at its main cheese and butter making base in the small hamlet of Wyke Champflower, near Bruton.

On 26 April, the TV legend made an appearance on Joe Lycett’s Channel 4 talk show, Late Night Lycett.

Of course, Lorraine’s time on the show was full of incredible moments, including her participation in the hilarious sketch “Straight Talking with Richard Yewtree” and revealing the controversial political guest who walked out of her show.

In addition to her comedic one-liners and adorable stories, the iconic presenter delivered an impactful and supportive message regarding the trans community.

When asked why she has dedicated time to being a trans ally, Lorraine said, “You know, why wouldn’t you?”

She added: “That’s what I don’t understand. I don’t see why I wouldn’t. It’s been so toxic and people just want to get on with their lives and everybody’s different I think we have to treat [people] as individuals.

“I’ve got trans friends who knew when they were three… then there are other people who maybe it was a bit more difficult for them. But at the end of the day I think we just need to have more kindness, more compassion and stop throwing rocks at one another.“

﻿

Lorraine’s recent appearance on Late Night Lycett isn’t the first time she has expressed support for the LGBTQIA+ community.

In a 2022 interview with GAY TIMES, she discussed the rise of anti-trans rhetoric around the world and the importance of standing up against hate.

“It really is hard, but do you know what? I think there’s so much more strength together,“ she said.

“I think it’s heartbreaking to see all the fractures that are happening and, like I say, a small minority making a lot of noise, but there’s strength in numbers, and there’s strength together, and I think that’s the most important thing and, you know, I would always say to anybody who’s going through anything, get help. Don’t be afraid to talk.”

The 64-year-old talent has also used her hit talk show Lorraine to support gay marriage.

In March, she hosted couple Luke Avaient and Gavin Sheppard’s wedding to celebrate the 10th anniversary of England and Wales legalising same-sex marriage.

“It’s a real privilege for me to be a witness to your wedding and to show people across the country that love is love,” she said while wearing a rainbow dress.

(KY3) - A viral social media trend called the “KIA challenge” is revealing an alarming loophole in the vehicle’s software, allowing anyone with a USB chord or screwdriver to steal the vehicle.

We’ve told you about this before and how the Springfield Police Department is looking to combat this growing trend by offering free safety devices for those vehicle owners in the Springfield area.

It may be called the “KIA challenge,” but this affects drivers of both Kia and Hyundais. SPD has been offering wheel locks to people in the Springfield area, but now they’re expanding that help to those living around Springfield too.

“Come to police headquarters between 7 a.m. and 5 p.m., and we want to give one to you to help keep your vehicle safe,” said Cris Swaters with the Springfield Police Department.

Across the country owners of Hyundais and Kias, have been the victim of what’s called the Kia Challenge. It shows users how to easily steal those vehicles with just a USB drive or a screwdriver.

“Previously, we had said Springfield area, but if you live in any of the surrounding communities, Nixa, Republic Ozark Willard Strafford, Marshfield pleasant hope any of those surrounding communities and you come into Springfield stopped by police HQ if you have a Kia or Hyundai, we want to help keep your vehicle safe too,” said Swaters.

It’s an issue that hits home for many, and it’s no different here at KY3. One of our producers, Zach Dodge, was on a trip for his birthday in St. Louis. He says around 3 a.m. one day, he and his wife noticed that someone had broken into their car.

“They smashed the back passenger side window,” said Dodge. “And whenever we went outside, there were no alarms or anything going off from our car. It wasn’t until he opened the drivers, the passenger side front door to get out that the alarms then started going off.”

Dodge says he wasn’t sure if these criminals were inspired by the trend on social media, until he noticed what the crooks left behind and looked deeper

“It was a screwdriver that was out from it,” he recalled. “So we’re we’re pretty sure he was trying to get access to underneath there where the ignition there’s like a spot where you can just jam something in a lot of the videos. It’s like a USB stick that they use. And it lets you be able to turn the ignition to start the car”

While Dodge hasn’t yet gotten his hands on one of the wheel locks, he says you should take the opportunity to make your car less of a target.

“Just follow those tips that I know Ashley Reynolds puts out all the time to keep your car clean. Keep the stuff out of your car, make it less enticing for someone to want to break into your vehicle,” said Dodge.

Now remember, this issue comes from the software in the vehicles, in light of that both Kia and Hyundai have websites to plug in your VIN to see if you’re eligible for a software upgrade. For KIA owners, click here. For Hyundai owners, click here.

Today, family and community members held a demonstration, in hopes others would join in on the battle to get the name of the officer who shot her.

“When I found out about it, I was outraged,” said Austin Hagston, protest organizer.

Joplin resident Austin Hagston first heard about the Clesslynn Crawford case from a radio program last month around the anniversary of her death.

“Being that it’s been two years and I had heard nothing about it, it was just terrible to me,” said Hagston.

He organized this protest for two-year-old, who died during a hostage situation in Baxter Springs in March 2022.

More details emerge in Baxter Springs shooting

Clesslynn’s father, Eli Crawford, killed her mother, Taylor Shutte, in front of officers and then proceeded to fire hundreds of rounds at police officers.

Officials say after Clesslynn was shot in the head, Crawford then killed himself, ending the hours-long standoff.

The investigation revealed a JPD officer — who has only been referred to as “Sniper One” — fired the fatal shot.

Joplin officer cleared in toddler’s death

“The officer who’s been unnamed fired the fatal shot at 9:35 on March 26, 2022,” said Hagston.

Hagston, along with several others, want “Sniper One’s” identity revealed.

Legal battle over “Sniper One” identity intensifies

The officer filed a lawsuit to keep his name out of all the reports in the case.

“There’s no accountability being held for this loss,” said Hagston.

The group says it would be “justice for Clesslynn.”

“You can’t sweep something like this under the rug. You can’t take a child away from a family and then pretend like it never happened,” said Hagston.

The protest eventually moved to 7th and Range Line, but organizers hope to hold another demonstration to draw more attention to the case.

“This event, it happened in my own backyard. I have a daughter who’s the same age practically, and it’s just… I couldn’t sit this one out, you know, I had to stand up for this one,” said Hagston.

Billboard at 20th and Range Line, in Joplin.

Joplin police issued a statement on the protest saying, “We respect everyone’s right to peacefully protest as long as they maintain and adhere to pedestrian and traffic laws so as not to impede the transit of pedestrians and motorists not involved in their exercise of free speech.”

PHUKET: Police have apprehended a hot-headed van driver who pulled a knife and threatened a taxi driver in the middle of one of the island’s busiest roads yesterday (Apr 27).

Sunday 28 April 2024 10:30 AM

The incident happened yesterday afternoon near the Central Phuket intersection of Chaloem Phrakiat Rama 9 Road, heading south and was very quickly posted on social media by witnesses who snapped footage of the agitated driver confronting the taxi driver.

Officials at the Phuket Transport Office were informed of the incident who duely contacted Wichit police to deal with the matter.

Pol. Col. Chatri Chukaew, superintendent of Wichit Police Station, ordered a team to investigate the matter who were very quickly able to identify the driver of the white Toyota van via the vehicle’s license plates before tracking him down to an address in Thalang.

The offender was subsequently identified as 57-year-old Thanongsak Maenman, of Village No. 1, Thepkrasattri Subdistrict, Thalang.

Police took the man to Wichit police station where blood and urine tests were conducted to determine any traces of alcohol or drugs – both tests returned negative, police confirmed.

In relaying his version of the incident to police, Mr Thanongsak claimed the driver of the yellow-plated, Phuket-registered taxi was driving extremely slowly in the right hand lane. Angered at the slow pace, Mr Thanongsak sounded his horn before pulling along side the taxi as traffic slowed. He then proceeded to exit his vehicle and advance to the driver’s side of the taxi where a heated argument ensued. Mr Thanongsak then pulled a fruit peeler style knife and threatened the driver before the latter managed to drive away.

The taxi driver subsequently lodged an official complaint with Wichit Police who then charged Mr Thanongsak, once he had been apprehended.

He was charged with “taking a weapon (knife) into a city, village or public way openly or without reasonable cause [and] causing others to be afraid or frightened by threatening behaviour.” Legal action and formal charges will follow in due course, police confirmed."

The court heard from prosecutor Chris Youell that Catling began smashing up property, trying to start fires, revving a chainsaw and tried to overdose.

This behaviour disturbed his neighbours and they felt forced to call police.

Armed police detained the defendant and took him to the police station where he continued having the break down and smeared his faeces over his cell, the court heard.

Mr Youell told the court Catling “essentially just wanted to kill himself and had completely lost a grip on his existence”.

Catling admitted destroying property, possession of cannabis and amphetamines and affray.

Judge Nicola Talbot-Hadley was pleased to hear from Mr Brown that Catling is now “in a much better place” and gave the defendant an 18-month community order with 25 rehabilitation activity days, 50 hours of unpaid work and 12 sessions of mental health treatment."

(WECT) - A Wilmington man is in custody after leading police on a chase on Saturday, April 27, according to the Carolina Beach Police Department.

Per the CBPD, 22-year-old Nasir Kawaski Logan was charged with over two dozen charges in connection to the chase.

He was assigned a court-appointed attorney during his first court appearance on Monday, April 29, and his bond was set to $55,000. If he makes bond, he will still not be allowed to operate a motor vehicle.

He was initially pulled over for speeding just after 6:30 p.m. at the intersection of Lake Park Boulevard and Fayetteville Avenue in Carolina Beach.

Once pulled over, officers say the situation became a narcotics investigation.

Logan then drove off, leading police on a chase. During the chase, Carolina Beach police say Logan hit several police vehicles with his car. Prosecutors said in court that he ran at least five stop signs through oncoming traffic and hit a civilian vehicle as well.

“During the pursuit, the driver attempted to evade police by entering the driveway of a condominium complex off Saint Joseph St., which is a dead-end road,” the CBPD states. “After Logan turned around in an attempt to exit the dead-end road, he struck the Carolina Beach Police officer’s vehicle.

“The pursuit continued to Snows Cut bridge where the driver attempted to strike two CBPD vehicles head-on while driving over the bridge median several times. Patrol units continued the pursuit into New Hanover County.”

The New Hanover County Sheriff’s Office and Kure Beach Police Department assisted in the chase, which ended in the 4800 block of South College Road, just north of Monkey Junction.

There, Logan got out of his vehicle and started running.

Police say he went through a townhome at Mandeline Place, exiting out the back door. Police eventually caught and arrested him as he was trying to enter an officer’s vehicle.

For organizers, it’s not just about making the river through Wichita look better but also about having an impact downstream by keeping plastic and waste out of the environment for wildlife and, eventually, the ocean.

It’s about teaching kids the importance of addressing pollution and the idea that small actions can add up to make a big difference.

“Every person can make a difference by going out and picking up a piece of trash, making sure to recycle and reducing that consumption and that’s such a great celebration to see people coming together to make Wichita the great place it is to live,” said Schanee Anderson, Sedgwick County Zoo, curator of education and farms.

Last year’s cleanup pulled 1.6 tons of trash out of the Arkansas River.

An agreement – which is worth in excess of £470,000 – will now be signed with industry leading manufacturer Econ Engineering.

“I wonder what their names will be,” Councillor John Shaw, board convener and SNP representative for Renfrew North and Braehead, quipped at the meeting.

A report to the board explained: “Renfrewshire Council have a requirement for the hire of five x 18T gritters for a period of three gritting seasons to assist with the council’s winter gritting programme.

“Renfrewshire Council’s environment, housing and infrastructure service has a statutory obligation to have gritters in place to assist with the council’s winter gritting programme.

Stop Unwanted Access in Your ChatGPT Account

The “Sign Out of All Accounts” allows you to sign out of devices with a single click. However, ChatGPT currently doesn’t come with this feature, making it hard for someone who wants to remove their account from unknown devices.

To secure your account, you can try resetting your password or adding two-factor authentication. If you are signed in with your Google account, you can change the password for your Google account. However, in most cases, ChatGPT keeps the current session active and these steps might not work. In that case, you can delete your account.

Remember, if you subscribed to the premium, you might lose access to your premium subscription linked to the account when you delete it. To avoid this, you can delete your account at the end of the subscription plan or if you are using a free version you can back up your chats and delete your account."

Concerned locals stumbling upon the dumped animals are rallying to rehome the dogs via social media.

On February 1 it became a crime to own, sell, abandon, rehome, breed or give away an XL Bully dog without a certificate of exemption. Now almost three months on since the breed was added to the 'dangerous dogs list' in a move designed to ""protect the public"", unwanted animals are being discarded, only to be picked up by worried members of the public.

In their desperation to save unregistered dogs from destruction, some will avoid calling police or authorities, instead posting to Facebook for help rehousing the pets. Since the new law - which sparked confusion, concern and frustrations across the city - people have been divided in their opinions, with many of the firm belief ""it's not the breed, it's how it's being treated.""

Read more: Killer that's claimed over 10,000 lives as yearly death toll reaches 'highest on record'

Others however, strongly support the ban, citing the horrifying impact of recent tragedies and attacks - along with the potential dangers. Under the law, the dogs, said to be behind a concerning rise in attacks, must be muzzled and held on a lead in public.

Only this month in the city, a series of social media posts reported suspected XL Bullies 'wandering, running or tied to posts in parks'. Two weeks ago, a brown XL Bully type was seen running in the Frankley area, but was ""too fast to catch"", said a member of the public. She told how she called the lone animal over to her, but it ""ran and was too quick to follow.""

Sharing a missing appeal to Facebook instead of ringing the authorities amid fears the dog could be put down, she posted: ""Anybody missing a dog in Frankley it’s brown looks like an XL Bully maybe?"" Responding to the post, one warned her ""don’t report it to anyone the poor b***** will be kept by the old bill.""

She then replied: ""I know that’s why I’ve posted on here instead of ringing anybody."" It was said to be the ""second XL reported"" that day, with fury over ""irresponsible owners"" dumping them across Birmingham. According to official advice, abandoned XL Bullies should be reported to the council, but if there are concerns over their behaviour, police should be called.

Several more suspected XL Bullies were this week reported abandoned and tied to the base of trees in Birmingham parks on social media. Locals could be seen offering to take in the banned dogs, although it's illegal to rehome the breed.

On Tuesday morning, a city dad on the school run took to Facebook to share his concern for a suspected XL Bully tied to a tree outside a bus stop in Harborne. He said: ""I don't know why people do this, it's so horrible if I didn't have two dogs myself I would have taken it in.

""It's not the breed or the animal, it's how it's being treated I've had dogs all my life and never had any problems."" Several warned of the potential 'fate' of the dog, especially as the dog had ""cropped ears"" and was therefore ""unlikely to be exempt.""

One said: ""This is absolutely heart-breaking, I hope someone can rescue him before dog warden gets him otherwise his fate is doomed."" A second advised to contact a foster or charity as she actively warned: ""You will be sentencing them to their death.""

However, the sighting of the dog in Harborne had sparked multiple calls to the police, with several members of the public - including the dad - reporting the abandoned pet to West Midlands Police as advised. Many were left furious by the abandonment, with one even left in tears.

""This has actually made me cry that somebody could do this,"" one wrote to the appeal. ""Hopefully the dog will find a new loving home that it deserves."" It's understood the dog was taken in by a foster carer, who washed and fed the pet.

Only the day before, another dog described as ""scared but in good temperament"" was discovered in Selly Oak Park. The member of the public contacted the police before posting images of the dog, secured on a lead. ""Please help does anyone know this dog,"" she asked on Monday (April 22).

""We’ve found her tied to a tree at the bottom of the park, she’s scared but has good temperament! Police contacted but she’s on her way to the vets!"" The dog was ""kept safe"" until the dog warden collected her, she said in an update.

She wrote: ""She was chipped! Really hoping for a positive outcome as she was beautiful and had the most gentle temperament! Discarding and treating animals this way is a disgrace and I hope whoever did this gets found, reported and dealt with! If you really can’t care for your pet anymore there are organisations you can call and get help!""

In other posts, several people were trying to rehome their XL Bullies on Facebook, asking anyone who could help to direct message them. Posts were often met with a string of responses tagging willing fosterers for the animals.

Approached for a comment, West Midlands Police abandoned dogs fell under the responsibility of the local authority under the Environmental Protection Act 1990, Section 149. BirminghamLive has contacted Birmingham City Council and the RSPCA for statements."

Everything gets smaller as you turn off the main street running through Balsall Heath and onto Clifton Road. Larger houses morph into terraces and it is single lane only as you pass under a railway bridge by the community farm.

Then piercing through the skyline is the ghostly, now-burned out spire of the former Clifton Primary School. Built in 1878, the imposing Victorian building went up in flames on Monday, with 32 fire fighters tackling the fierce blaze with a hydraulic platform jet at its peak.

It's been a few days since the inferno and the roof tiles have been stripped away revealing the charred skeleton of this once grand school. Demolition crews are preparing the heart-breaking task of dismantling the structure. They will begin with the once-commanding spire which has watched over this neighbourhood for generations.

Julie Penny lives across from the school. She worked there as a dinner lady and a teaching assistant for special needs children before it closed. All of her six children attended and Ms Penny, 64, happily recalls the secret stairways, heavy furnishings and big classrooms unlike modern school buildings.

""It was great, it was an old Victorian building with character. It had secret stairways you could hide in , it was old fashioned, with wooden desks.

(Image: Nick Wilkinson/Birmingham Live)

""Towards the end the classrooms had leaks and we had to use buckets to collect the rainwater. It closed as a primary school around 20 years ago and then was used as offices for St Paul's.

""I knew all the parents, children I taught. It's all the memories, the laughs with Mr Tatton the headteacher. The building has been standing empty for so long.""

We are now on WhatsApp. Join our dedicated community here

She added: ""On Monday we were told to stay in as debris was falling everywhere. Now it's going to be demolished and what are they going to put next?""

Teacher Dr Sarah Allen wrote on social media platform X: ""We are so sad to see our old Clifton building on fire. There are many of us who have happy memories of teaching here or being a pupil.

""I started teaching here in 1997 and Mrs Hemming in 1995. We have lots of staff children and parents who have memories.

""We are still Clifton Primary School, we just moved into a building round the corner. The old building has a special place in all our hearts.""

You could see the spire as you stood on Katie Field's doorstep but now it is burnt out wreckage. The grandmother-of-three, who has lived in the area for more than 30 years, said: ""It's really upsetting, the spire was so lovely - I watched the flames.

""The spire is hanging down, it was quite frightening. My son went there when it was a school, it was a beautiful building and it's a shame. I hope they restore it.""

One neighbour said: ""It's very sad. There used to be a playgroup and I took my daughter when she was five or six to Halloween parties, pumpkin making. Now it's gone and they will demolish it.""

And Ekaterina Luzinga, 29, said: ""I thought it was amazing. It's a shame it wasn't in use. I'm an artist and artists always admire big spaces that could be made into galleries.

""It needed to be a creative use - a workshop for the public.""

West Midlands Police said it's suspected the fire was started deliberately. Two boys, aged 16, were arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life. They have been released on bail while investigations continue.

The sentence was imposed on Thursday by High Court Judge Sandil Kissoon.

At his arraignment in February, the man denied the charge levelled against him.

Two weeks later on the day his trial was set to commence, he changed his plea, admitting that he did rape the young girl.

He owned-up to the prosecution’s case against him of preying on the 11-year-old whom he had dropped to an event.

Prosecutors say that later on the day in question, Barker returned for the child and drove her to a bushy area where he raped her in the back seat of his car.

When given a chance to address the court on Thursday, the offender said “I’m sorry for whatever act I committed. Sorry for whatever hurt that I’ve committed. I’m not a bad person. I pray to God. I am just hoping that this family could forgive me.”

Meanwhile, in his mitigating address to the court, the offender’s attorney, Ronald Bostwick, asked the Judge to consider his client’s early guilty plea; stating that there was no evidence of grooming.

In his sentencing remarks, Justice Kissoon said that he had considered the seriousness and prevalence of the offence of rape against children, the age-difference, and the impact the incident has had on the survivor and her family.

Justice Kissoon pointed out that Barker’s explanation to the court of being unaware “that the girl was so young;” was “unacceptable” and “inexcusable.”

The Judge said that persons providing such public services are held to a higher standard because of the trust their passengers would repose in them.

The state’s case was presented by prosecutors Nafeeza Baig and Latifah Elliot."
55,55,5,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20240428050122,20240428,74,"Medical schools that have been allocated additional seats anticipate opening a minimum of 1,500 new slots for the upcoming year, as they are set to make final decisions on their admissions availability following the government’s decision to grant flexibility in the quota allocation.

The government earlier said it would allow medical schools to freely adjust new seats within a 50 to 100 percent range of the enrollment quota given to them for the 2025 academic year. It announced in February that it would increase the quota by 2,000.

The limit has been capped at 3,058 per year since 2006, when it was lowered from 3,507 to assuage doctors protesting the policy of separating the prescribing and dispensing of drugs at that time.

While the admissions quota for the 32 medical schools that received the increase is slowly taking shape, the shrinking of quotas among national universities is likely to happen, according to reports Sunday, citing educational authorities.

Kyungpook National University, which has 110 seats in its current quota, has decided to accept 45 additional medical students for next year, half of the initially proposed increase. Gyeongsang National University and Jeju National University will recruit 62 and 30 new students, respectively, coming to half the planned expansion.

Chungbuk National University, which got the largest increase of 151 new admissions spots, will reportedly settle on its quota this week, along with Kangwon National University and Chungnam National University.

Private schools such as Yonsei University in Gangwon Province and Daegu Catholic University received seven and 40 new slots, respectively. Along with other private colleges such as Inje University, Kosin University, Dong-A University, Chosun University, Keimyung University and Yeungnam University, these private medical schools will likely fill all of their increased admissions quotas.

In line with the adjustment, the medical school enrollment quota would increase by 1,500 or 1,700 seats, from the currently proposed 2,000, according to observers.

Each university must submit its finalized enrollment quota to the Korean Council for University Education by the end of this month.

Meanwhile, five medical schools will likely start their first day of school next month, with students showing little signs of willingness to return and as medical professors are resigning.

Konyang University, Chosun University and Inha University -- which were initially to start classes Monday -- have postponed the start of their new semesters, according to reports. The three schools have yet to specify the date for the new academic calendar. Soonchunhyang University has not determined when classes will start, while Chung-Ang University starts school Wednesday.

While the finalized quota still hangs in the balance, Lim Hyun-taek, the new president of the Korean Medical Association, on Sunday repeated the demand for the total scrapping of the expansion plan, warning he would not respond to any talks with the government otherwise.

“This is not a conflict between the medical circle and the government, but (the government’s) unilateral abuse of power. If the government realizes the gravity of the situation, it should apologize to the public and the medical community as soon as possible,” Lim said at the KMA’s general meeting."
26,26,2,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20240428050122,20240428,75,"Medical schools that have been allocated additional seats anticipate opening a minimum of 1,500 new slots for the upcoming year, as they are set to make final decisions on their admissions availability following the government’s decision to grant flexibility in the quota allocation.

The government earlier said it would allow medical schools to freely adjust new seats within a 50 to 100 percent range of the enrollment quota given to them for the 2025 academic year. It announced in February that it would increase the quota by 2,000.

The limit has been capped at 3,058 per year since 2006, when it was lowered from 3,507 to assuage doctors protesting the policy of separating the prescribing and dispensing of drugs at that time.

While the admissions quota for the 32 medical schools that received the increase is slowly taking shape, the shrinking of quotas among national universities is likely to happen, according to reports Sunday, citing educational authorities.

Kyungpook National University, which has 110 seats in its current quota, has decided to accept 45 additional medical students for next year, half of the initially proposed increase. Gyeongsang National University and Jeju National University will recruit 62 and 30 new students, respectively, coming to half the planned expansion.

Chungbuk National University, which got the largest increase of 151 new admissions spots, will reportedly settle on its quota this week, along with Kangwon National University and Chungnam National University.

Private schools such as Yonsei University in Gangwon Province and Daegu Catholic University received seven and 40 new slots, respectively. Along with other private colleges such as Inje University, Kosin University, Dong-A University, Chosun University, Keimyung University and Yeungnam University, these private medical schools will likely fill all of their increased admissions quotas.

In line with the adjustment, the medical school enrollment quota would increase by 1,500 or 1,700 seats, from the currently proposed 2,000, according to observers.

Each university must submit its finalized enrollment quota to the Korean Council for University Education by the end of this month.

Meanwhile, five medical schools will likely start their first day of school next month, with students showing little signs of willingness to return and as medical professors are resigning.

Konyang University, Chosun University and Inha University -- which were initially to start classes Monday -- have postponed the start of their new semesters, according to reports. The three schools have yet to specify the date for the new academic calendar. Soonchunhyang University has not determined when classes will start, while Chung-Ang University starts school Wednesday.

While the finalized quota still hangs in the balance, Lim Hyun-taek, the new president of the Korean Medical Association, on Sunday repeated the demand for the total scrapping of the expansion plan, warning he would not respond to any talks with the government otherwise.

On April 2, this newspaper had reported that the parents of Jagnandan were demanding answers from the police over the circumstances of the death of their son.

The guard who was a suspect in the matter, was arrested at Vigilance Police Station and the shotgun lodged along with five live cartridges and one spent shell. He is no longer in police custody

The police in a statement had said that they were investigating the shooting which occurred at about 11.10 am on March 21 at Shaf Auto Sales located at Lot 157 Lusignan, East Coast Demerara. The incident involved a 20-year-old security officer attached to Cerberus Security Service, who was armed with a 12-gauge shotgun, which is owned by the security company and was used in the shooting death of Jagnandan.

Avalon Jagnandan, in an interview with Stabroek News had stated that the post-mortem examination showed that his son died from multiple gunshot wounds.

It is going to be a landslide victory for the BJP in Telangana in the Lok Sabha elections, Laxman, a member of BJP's parliamentary board, said.

The BJP won four seats in Telangana in the 2019 general elections.

''People from every nook and corner of the state are looking towards PM Modi, his development agenda and welfare schemes for the poor and his achievements during the last 10 years,'' he told PTI here.

In the Assembly polls held last year, people might have voted for the local issues, but they are definitely going to vote for Modi as their choice for PM in the Parliament elections, he said.

The Congress had won the Assembly elections, defeating the BRS which was in power since 2014 when Telangana was formed.

Asked what are the factors that will contribute to BJP's success in the present Lok Sabha elections, Laxman said Modi's charisma, his development agenda and zero-tolerance towards corruption are among the causes that will determine voters' choice in favour of BJP.

In Telangana, people are looking for development and that is possible only with the BJP under the leadership of Modi, he said.

''We will definitely cross double digits (in LS polls). Our seats will be more than all parties put together,'' said Laxman, a former president of BJP in Telangana.

Asked about Telangana Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy's remarks that the BJP would change the Constitution and abolish reservations, Laxman said the CM is speaking out of frustration.

Modi has repeatedly said he would not allow anybody to change the Constitution, Laxman, national president of BJP's OBC Morcha, pointed out.

''It is you (Congress) people who are working against the Constitution. You are giving communal reservations which is anti-Constitution,'' he said.

Architect of the Constitution Babasaheb Ambedkar never wanted religion-based reservations, but Congress is proposing religion-based reservations which is opposed by BJP, he said.

''You (Congress) are also now clinching away the rights of OBCs, SCs, STs by appeasing Muslim community,'' he said.

On the allegation that the BJP is increasingly raking up communal issues during the ongoing Lok Sabha election campaign, Laxman said it is the opposition parties who are repeatedly talking about reservations for Muslims and others.

''Modi speaks for the poor irrespective of caste, whether it is Hindu, Muslim or Christian. Modi says we are working for the poor, women, youth and farmers,'' he said.

The BJP, which won four seats in Telangana in the 2019 general elections, is hoping to win a majority of the constituencies now to add to its national kitty.

Barman has provided a list of 579 polling booths where he alleges that the elections were marred by fraudulent practices. He further accuses certain Assistant Returning Officers (AROs) in South, Gomati, and Sepahijala districts of pressuring micro observers to alter their reports regarding instances of massive false voting.

In a letter addressed to the Chief Electoral Officer of Tripura, Barman expressed disbelief at the CEO’s explanation of Election Duty Certificate (EDC) voting, which purportedly led to voter turnout exceeding 100 per cent in some polling stations. He cited examples of discrepancies in voter turnout compared to the number of registered voters in several booths.

Additionally, Barman highlighted instances of polling booths recording more than 100 per cent turnout and cited examples of voters being obstructed or prevented from casting their ballots without adequate intervention from law enforcement or election officials.

Accusing the election conducting body of biased treatment towards the opposition party, Barman demanded a complete re-poll in the West Tripura parliamentary constituency and the Ramnagar assembly constituency.

The prison and probation service missed opportunities when dealing with an offender who was later found hanged in his flat.

Christopher MacGillivray was handed an 18 month suspended prison sentence after being convicted of motoring offences in January 2021. The 34-year-old was allocated a Community Offender Manager (COM) at North Tyneside Probation to manage his sentence.

Two months later, MacGillivray received an additional 16-and-a-half month suspended prison sentence after being convicted of violence offences. The sentence ran alongside the one he was already serving.

MacGillivray's COM reviewed his risk assessment report on April 7. The assessment noted a previous suicide attempt but did not assess MacGillivray posed a risk to himself.

On April 16, 2021, CCTV operators alerted police after they saw MacGillivray standing on a bridge. He told police he was having difficulties with alcohol, drugs and his relationship but he was not suicidal.

Police passed this information to probation and MacGillivray’s COM logged it on his probation record on April 19. There is no record that his COM discussed the incident with him or that he updated his risk assessment.

On 19 May, a new COM took over MacGillivray’s case. The two COMs said there was a handover, which consisted of an informal conversation about MacGillivray’s risk factors and current concerns. However this was not recorded on probation records.

The new COM said she read through MacGillivray’s record but despite this, she said she was not aware of the events of April 16.

On September 17, 2021, police arrested MacGillivray for theft from a motor vehicle. He was given bail and a condition of this was a curfew which was monitored electronically.

The following month, on October 9, a member of the public reported to police that they were concerned about someone they saw on a bridge. Police attended and found MacGillivray.

Remanded in custody

He was found to have breached his curfew, so was arrested for breach of bail conditions. He was remanded in custody and transferred to HMP Durham the following day.

Police records state that officers had no concerns about MacGillivray. However, when he arrived at Durham, he had documentation with him stating he had been under constant watch in police custody.

On 10 October, 2021, MacGillivray told a member of the drug and alcohol recovery team (DART) that he might harm himself. Prison staff started suicide and self-harm prevention procedures (known as ACCT) and he was put on hourly observations.

The same day, a prison nurse completed a mental health assessment with MacGillivray. She assessed that he did not need to be under the care of the mental health team but that he should continue to work with DART. She noted that he appeared under the influence and did not engage fully with the assessment.

At an ACCT review the next day, MacGillivray said that he did not expect to be in prison for long as he was expecting to get bail. On October 12, the court granted MacGillivray bail

Prison staff held an ACCT review with MacGillivray who said he was pleased to be getting out. They closed the ACCT and did not pass any information about it to the probation service.

Two days later, MacGillivray’s ex-partner found him hanged in his flat. Paramedics attended and at 2.30pm on October 14 and pronounced him dead.

MacGillivray’s previous COM said he found out about MacGillivray’s death from a police officer that worked with probation and he was not offered any support.

MacGillivray's most recent COM said she thought a Senior Probation Officer (SPO) had told her of MacGillivray's death. She said she was not offered any support but she felt confident that she knew who to approach if she was struggling.

An inquest into MacGillivray's death, held on April 8 this year, concluded that he hanged himself whilst under the influence of a combination of cocaine and alcohol. A post-mortem concluded that he died from pressure to his neck from hanging.

Missed opportunities

An independent investigation was carried out by the Prisons & Probation Ombudsman (PPO) following MacGillivray's death.

They recorded that he was managed under Prison Service suicide and self-harm procedures (known as ACCT) from October 10 up to his release from the category B prison.

They were ""very concerned"" that the prison did not tell probation staff about this or provide any details about why he had been assessed as at risk of suicide and self-harm.

The PPO also found that the Community Offender Manager (COM) missed an opportunity to explore this bridge incident in April 2021 with MacGillivray.

They said there was a ""missed opportunity"" to explore the incident, which may have led to completing work around suicide and safety planning, or how MacGillivray could manage low moods.

They said: ""Mr MacGillivray had made previous suicide attempts and this should have been explored further.""

The PPO recommended that the Regional Probation Director North East should ensure that incidents of concern are explored and relevant intervention work is completed if required.

The PPO found that there was a further missed opportunity for the new COM to explore the same incident when his case was transferred to them on May 19, 2021.

They said both COMs told the investigator that a handover took place, which was an informal conversation highlighting risk factors and current concerns. However, this was not logged on probation systems.

The new COM told the investigator that, when given a new case, they were required to review the records. They said that following her review of MacGillivray’s records, she had no concerns around suicide or self-harm.

She also said she wasn't aware of the incident on April 16 - despite it being recorded in the probation records.

The PPO found that the case handover between that COM and the subsequent COM was not thorough.

They recommended that the Regional Probation Director North East should ensure that officers complete detailed handovers when a case is transferred and record details in the probation record; undertake a thorough review of records when given a new case.

They also noted that COMs should be made aware of support services available to them, such as counselling, after a death and told they can use these services at a later date if required.

They found that the process was not followed and the COMs who worked closely with MacGillivray were not offered support following his death.

The PPO recommended that the Regional Probation Director North East should ensure COMs are offered support following the death of a service user on their caseload.

A Prison Service spokesperson said: ""Our thoughts remain with Mr MacGillivray's family and friends.

""We have accepted all of the Ombudsman’s recommendations and measures have been put in place to ensure frontline staff share all vital information with the local probation team when an individual who has been supported with their safety and wellbeing leaves prison."""

If you’ve already set up a Microsoft account, don’t despair: You still aren’t locked into using a cloud-based account on your PC. Instead, you can actually disconnect your Microsoft account from the cloud and turn it into a local account instead.

You won’t lose any of your information or data if you follow this method, allowing you to cut the ties with Microsoft’s various cloud services and still make the most of your Windows 11 PC.

How to remove your Microsoft account from Windows

To get started, open the Windows 11 settings menu. This can be found by pressing Windows Key + I or by opening the Start Menu and selecting the Settings cog.

Click Account > Your Info > Sign in with a local account instead. Then, enter a new password for your local account and confirm the change. Windows will save your changes and switch your Microsoft account to a local account that’s stored directly on the PC. You can still access your Microsoft account online with the information that you used before, but your Windows 11 PC will no longer be tied directly to that account.

How to remove a work or school account from Windows 11

If you’re using a school or work account, then removing them is somewhat similar.

Open the Windows settings by pressing Windows Key + I. Navigate to Accounts > Access work or school and then click Disconnect. This will remove your work or school account from Windows 11. Keep in mind it will also lock out any features that you had access to through those accounts, like Microsoft Teams.

Why you may want to remove your Microsoft account from Windows

Having a Microsoft account tied to your Windows 11 account gives you access to a ton of additional features, like Copilot and OneDrive. But if you want to take a more private approach to how you use your PC, then disconnecting your account cuts off Microsoft’s access to your data. It does mean you’ll lose out on features like cloud storage, but on the other hand, you’ll have more control over what data Microsoft is able to capture and share with advertisers."

Mr Braithwaite did want to give the exact location of the woodland as he did not want to attract public attention to the area.

However, he said that not only was it the first time in two decades since a red squirrel was spotted in that area, a groundsman who had been working there for years told him that he had never seen one.

One of the only population centres left in England for red squirrels after greys were introduced in the late nineteenth century has been the Lake District.

Red squirrel populations decline quickly when greys move into an area, because of competition and disease (Image: Jason Braithwaite)

Even defending this area has been a challenge with Mr Braithwaite saying that red squirrels could go extinct in the Lakes within 15 years if the greys are allowed to move in.

Mr Braithwaite writes articles on red squirrel conservation as JDJ Braithwaite. His methods can be seen as controversial as he uses an air rifle to shoot grey squirrels 'humanely' via setting up feeders and then using a hide rather than trapping.

He uses cameras to see what animals are using the feeder, using that as a basis to plan out where he will go.

He uses shooting rather than trapping as a method of removing greys from an area (Image: Jason Braithwaite)

He said: ""I take it very seriously to make sure its as clean and humane as it can be.""

He argues that it is possible to accidentally trap red squirrels and leave them there 'for two or three hours' and the stressful experience can affect breeding, as well as the fact he 'doesn't have the time' to go round and free them again.

There are two mating seasons per year for squirrels, which means that greys can quickly repopulate if they are not continually removed. Mr Braithwaite said he has removed hundreds of greys in the last 30 years, with permission given to him by landowners to cover many acres of woodland in the Lune Valley. Although there are red squirrel conservation groups, he said that he works alone.

According to both Mr Braithwaite and the BBC Wildlife Magazine, grey squirrels not only outcompete reds but also bring parapox which can devastate red populations. Grey squirrels can also eat seeds and nuts before they ripen, unlike reds, and the greys strip the bark off juvenile trees to get to the sap."

According to Siddaramaiah, against the demand for Rs 18,171 crore for drought relief, the union government ordered release of only Rs 3,454 crore, that too after the state approached the Supreme Court.

The amount was not even a quarter of the state's demand, he noted.

SoundHound AI (SOUN 0.22%) garnered a lot of attention after it was revealed that it was one of four stocks, along with Arm Holdings (ARM 3.78%), that Nvidia (NVDA 3.46%) invested in late last year. Nvidia took some of its ample cash and invested in companies it thought could greatly benefit from the upcoming artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.

Now there is a huge difference in size between SoundHound, which has a market cap of just over $1 billion, and Arm, which has a market cap of nearly $100 billion. Despite being just about one-hundredth of the size of Arm, SoundHound does share some intriguing similarities with the company.

A royalty revenue model

One trait that helped lift Arm to where the company is today is its business model, which generates a lot of recurring revenue over long periods of time. The company licenses its technology to other companies getting upfront payments, but then collects royalties thereafter on every chip a customer ships based on its architecture. The model has proven to be so enduring that nearly half of Arm's royalty revenue comes from products that were introduced in 2012 or before.

SoundHound also derives much of its revenue from royalties. In fact, over 94% of its revenue in 2023 came from product royalties. With SoundHound's model, customers incorporate its voice AI platform into their devices, such as automobiles, third-party assistants, or smart TVs. SoundHound then collects royalty payments based on volume, usage, or life of the applicable product.

The company has also started to sell its platform via subscriptions for use cases that don't have a product attached to it. SoundHound has done a good job making inroads with its technology into the restaurant industry. Since there is no product attached to its technology in this industry, it sells its service as a subscription. This is also another recurring revenue stream, which helps add predictability to its business.

AI beneficiaries

Both Arm and SoundHound are also current beneficiaries of the AI revolution. Arm is seeing growth pick up as new end devices, such as smartphones, need more of its technology incorporated in central processing units (CPUs) to handle AI applications.

SoundHound, meanwhile, has seen its backlog grow as AI has quickly gone from being accepted to becoming expected. Its technology helps voice assistants and humans interact more naturally, as well as allows for more complex questions and answers.

The automobile industry has been one of the driving forces in embracing its platform; the company has relationships with more than 20 auto brands. The restaurant industry is quickly following suit with the company signing deals with restaurant chains as well as restaurant-focused fintech companies such as Toast and Olo.

Both Soundhound and Arm have teamed up with Nvidia. Arm's technology is being used in Nvidia's Grace Hopper Superchip, which combines CPUs with GPUs to help handle AI workloads more quickly while using less power. SoundHound, meanwhile, partnered with Nvidia to develop an in-vehicle voice platform running on the Nvidia Drive platform that doesn't need internet connectivity. Among the use cases for this technology will be retrieving information directly from a vehicle's user manual.

SoundHound is in its early stages

SoundHound hasn't produced a lot of revenue yet, with the company reporting a 47% increase in revenue to $45.9 million for 2023. What it does have, though, is a large booking backlog of $661 million. These are signed contracts that if honored will turn into future revenue. The weighted average length of its contracts is about six and a half years, so that would average out to about $100 million in revenue per year just from currently signed contracts over that time. Some of this is back-end loaded, so don't expect $100 million in revenue next year, but it does set the company up for solid future revenue growth.

Meanwhile, as AI becomes more incorporated into everyday lives, more automobile manufacturers will look to add SoundHound's platform into their vehicles and more industries will look to use its technology. The company will also continue to innovate and offer new products.

That sets SoundHound up for strong potential growth in the years ahead. Now will SoundHound grow to the heights of Arm? That's a difficult task, but it is possible. Arm was able to get its CPU architecture into nearly every smartphone made. If SoundHound's AI voice technology can be incorporated into most smartphones, it can follow a similar path.

That said, SoundHound doesn't need to be the next Arm for an investment in the stock to be successful. If the company can continue to get wins in the auto and restaurant spaces and then perhaps capture some of the higher-end smartphone market, it will have a lot of long-term upside from here."

There was a fire incident at about 5 pm caused by a lone accident of a gas truck with the inscription Gasco Marine, at Ita Oshin junction a few metres from the roundabout.

The truck, moving inward Abeokuta, lost control and ran into the road pavement before it eventually stopped.

The driver fled the scene while the truck boy lost his life. His mutilated remains have been deposited at the General Hospital, Ijaiye.

It was gathered that four parked vehicles were burnt to ashes. The inferno also affected five shops, with one completely burnt.

Four trucks from the Federal and the Ogun State Fire Services were on the ground to put out the inferno.

Governor Abiodun, in a statement on Saturday night, regretted the loss of life in the inferno and the attendant destruction of properties.

He, however, called for calm, assuring that everything was being done to put the situation under control.

“I am deeply saddened by the tragic gas explosion that occurred in Abeokuta, Ogun State on Saturday, which led to the loss of an innocent life and destruction of properties. This is a devastating incident that has brought pain and anguish to many families,” he said

“On behalf of the government and people of Ogun State, I extend my heartfelt condolences to the family of the lone victim of this tragic incident. My prayers are with them during this difficult time.

“I also wish to express my sympathy to those who suffered damage to their businesses.”

The governor praised the quick intervention of relevant agencies of government and first responders, which brought the situation under control.

Governor Abiodun noted that relevant authorities have been mandated to ascertain the cause of the explosion and ensure that appropriate measures are put in place to prevent a recurrence.

16,16,1,https://www.foxcarolina.com/2024/04/27/lawsuit-richland-county-man-wrongfully-indicted-arrested-drug-gun-crimes/,20240428,98,"RICHLAND COUNTY, S.C. (WIS) – A Richland County man who was wrongfully indicted, arrested, detained and accused of several drug and gun crimes is filing a federal civil rights lawsuit as he works to clear his name.

Federal agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), working in conjunction with local law enforcement, showed up to Bryan Wilson’s work last December after obtaining an 8-count indictment against him.

But he was completely innocent, and the charges were dismissed that same day.

Wilson, 33, said he is now on a relentless pursuit of answers and justice.

“Something got messed up and they landed on me,” he said in a Friday interview at his home. “I don’t know how this happened, but it can’t happen again. It shouldn’t happen again.”

He is a father, brother and son.

Wilson, who has no criminal record, makes an honest living as a material processor for a railroad equipment supplier.

He described the harrowing experience on Dec. 13 when he was “humiliated” in front of his co-workers, facing significant time for crimes he had nothing to do with.

“I always thought federal agents, they were like the most thorough, when it came to law enforcement,” he said. “I always thought, okay, they wouldn’t make mistakes like this.”

It all started around 8:30 a.m., when federal agents took Wilson into custody at his job after searching him and patting him down.

“I immediately tell them, ‘Yo, you have the wrong person, like I’m not involved in any criminal element whatsoever,’” he said. “But of course, that kind of fell on deaf ears.”

He said he spent the entire day professing his innocence to “anybody who would listen.”

As Wilson was being led outside of his workplace in handcuffs, he noticed additional officers searching his car.

He was then taken to the federal courthouse in Columbia where he was arraigned before a magistrate judge.

At that point, a federal agent outlined that they have been surveilling Wilson for 13 months, and the ATF claimed that he sold guns to West Columbia police officers.

He was charged with five counts of possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance and three counts of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense.

Upon reading the indictment, Wilson said that is when the real fear set in as he realized he was facing up to 115 years in prison and up to $17 million in fines.

Wilson said he was “panicking,” trying to explain himself to his public defender.

His family was in the courtroom, listening in disbelief.

“When they read the charges, I was about to stroke out,” Judith Wilson Johnson, Wilson’s mother, said. “My husband and my other son were like, ‘Calm down, calm down, Ma.’ I said, ‘No, they got the wrong person. We need to let them know they got the wrong person.’ And nobody was listening.”

Incident reports from West Columbia police list the alleged perpetrator’s address as Wilson’s, and describe an appearance matching his.

After Wilson spends hours in a cell, the government moved to dismiss the charges with prejudice, meaning they cannot be brought again.

However, little explanation is offered as to what happened.

“Further review of the case reveals that the interests of justice would best be served by a dismissal of the pending charges as opposed to further prosecution,” the government’s motion reads in part. “Based on the foregoing, the government respectfully requests that the Court dismiss the pending charges against defendant Bryan Montiea Wilson.”

It is unclear if federal agents were able to track down the criminal who was caught on camera selling drugs and firearms.

“I haven’t seen any information about them arresting the guy who they were looking for in my place,” Wilson said. “I haven’t seen anything about it. We don’t know anything. All the departments involved are being real tight-lipped about it. We don’t know anything about that. That guy could be long gone.”

Wilson is freed later that evening, but has been living with the painful aftermath ever since.

“For awhile after this, I was worried my phone was tapped for some reason,” he said. “I’m like, man did they bug my place? Like what’s going on?”

Wilson said his life was “almost ruined,” and his reputation is in the mud with many co-workers, who have spread nasty rumors about him.

Whenever he leaves the house, Wilson’s mother is now worried sick.

He has lost friends, lost sleep, and started having migraines for the first time in his life.

“For it to happen to me, man, it just kind of puts a real fear in your stomach about this whole thing,” Wilson said. “It can happen to anybody. Like this could happen to me, it could happen to you, it could happen to any of our family members, right? It could happen to anyone. So, just knowing that, man, it kind of keeps me up at night.”

Two West Columbia police officers are the defendants in this civil rights lawsuit.

A West Columbia Police Department spokesperson said they cannot comment on pending litigation.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the ATF would not comment for this story either.
